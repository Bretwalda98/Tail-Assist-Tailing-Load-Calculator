# Tail Assist – Tailing Load Calculator

**Tail Assist** is a web-based engineering tool for calculating and visualising loads during tailing operations.  
It replicates the logic of traditional spreadsheet methods, but adds interactive geometry graphics, load charts, and angle sweeps.

---

## Features
- 📐 **Accurate load calculation** – split of load between main crane and tail crane.
- 🎨 **Live geometry view** – schematic drawing updates with angle and distances.
- 📊 **Angle sweep table** – shows hook-to-hook distance, main crane load, and tail crane load across a range of angles.
- 📈 **Charts** – quick visualisation of how each crane’s load changes with angle.
- ⚡ **Instant updates** – modify vessel weight, distances, rigging extras, and crane capacities in real-time.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
3. Enter your project values (weight, distances, crane extras, etc.).
4. Use the angle slider to simulate the tailing process and view results.

## Use Cases
- Engineering lift planning
- Pre-checking crane capacities
- Visual aid in method statements and risk assessments

---

## Notes
- All values are in **metric tonnes [t]**, with conversions to kips where relevant.
- Geometry is **schematic only** (not to scale).
- 1 t = 2.20462 kip.
